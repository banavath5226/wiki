    <h2 style="color:blue">Rakesh P of Deccan Herald called the storyline "trite", but the film "still manages to capture young hearts, for it`s shot in a free-wheeling and fluid fashion".[4] Manjula Kumar of The Indian Express wrote "Good performances, breathtaking shots of New Zealand and scintillating music by Ramana Gogula are plus points".[5] The film had collected a distributors' share of Rs.85 million in its complete theatrical run.[6]
